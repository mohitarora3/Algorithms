The simple solution of the problem is, send the contestants in decreasing order of the sum of projected biking and running time.

Since, the solutions just adds the projected biking and running times, then sorts the total in decreasing order.

The algorithm takes  T(n)=O(n2) time, as sorting is done using insertion sort.
