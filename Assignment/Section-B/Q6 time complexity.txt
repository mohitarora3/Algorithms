Question 6,

Since, the approach followed is divide and conquer.

Function divideInput(int *, int, int)
Divides the input into equal halves.

Function check(int, int *, int, int)
Checks whether the element is in majority or not. It takes O(n) time.


Let us denote the running time of the algorithm on array of size ‘n’, by T(n). 
Then,

T(n) is, 
T(⌈n/2⌉) + T(⌊n/2⌋) +O(n),		if n>2
O(1),		if n≤2

The master theorem shows that T(n)=O(nlogn).
