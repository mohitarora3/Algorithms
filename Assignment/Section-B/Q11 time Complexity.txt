          Question no-11
                                                                          						*/
Total no. of people = N
Minimum no. of people required in each group = K

Recurrence relation:	T(n,m) = T(n-m,m) + T(n,m-1)	;	n, m <= N
			T(0,m) = 1
			T(n,0) = 0
			T(n,m) = 0			;	n < K or m < K

The base cases take constant time - O(1).
Size of memoize_table is N x N.
We will be calcuting values of memoize_table[n][m] for n,m <= N only once since we are 
returning immediately if its value is already computed.
Therefore, total time complexity is O(N^2). 

Time complexity:	O(N^2)
Space complexity:	O(N^2)
